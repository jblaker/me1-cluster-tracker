Mass Effect 1 Cluster Exploration Tracker
===================

Utility to track exploration of clusters in Mass Effect 1. Simple and helpful.

Users will be able to drill down to planets by Cluster > System > Planets and mark a planet as explored and additionally flag it and leave some notes so they can come back later. 

Systems and clusters will show a complete percentage based on the planets completed within them. 

On first launch NSManagedObjects will be created with our initial data stored in a plist. Storing in core data will let us set flags and store notes easier.
